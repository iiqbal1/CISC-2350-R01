		      <center><h1>The “See” of Bengalis </h1></center>
		      <p>Race in the American culture is difficult to absorb for many outsiders. How can a seven year old from Bangladesh comprehend the concept of race if he's surrounded by Bengalis? Approximately 98% of Bangladesh’s population are considered Bengali. (Country Studies) He is unaware of vital issues regarding race in the Western World; he does not even know what race is! He knows his skin is darker than the average and his mother compares his complexity with his sister’s; almost creating a competition. He sees commercials about beauty products which “enhances” the user's skin, making it brighter than any walls. How can his mother, who has been brainwashed with the idea of beauty with brightness all her life, react to a society which determines otherwise? How can I convince someone stubbornly traditional, that beauty is subjective; or at least, beauty is beyond a specific attribute.  
A subliminal form of colorism developed due to all the “white beauty” commercials I saw as a child. The advertisement would start off with an insecure individual being introduced to a cosmetic: “Fair and Lovely” moisturizer. A time lapse would reveal the user appearing more confident and fairer. Initially, these commercials did not phase my own physicality; mainly because female actors were being portrayed. Soon enough, Fair and Lovely released advertisements with major male film actors who appears to look confident because they use this moisturizer. I was self conscious about my appearance; not only my skin color but also because I was “obese”. I’d always feel ashamed of myself based on men being portrayed in media. I was not worried about my weight as much as my skin. I can change that if I wanted to in the future. But my skin? This was something permanent, natural, something I would have to live with for the rest of my life.
I now realize I was once colorist, I was unaware; an adolescent who was absorbing whatever that was given to him. The thought of foreigners, before I came to America would only create an the image of  “white people”. I subconsciously associating power/authority based on the color of one's skin. However, I was introduced to a world of a new group of people when I came to the Bronx. I lived in a neighborhood and went to school with people of black or hispanic descent. My views about color did not change until I went to middle school. I was the only Asian, let alone Bangali kid in school. I was now the 2% of the class. I stood out like a sore thumb. However, most of the kids in school were friendly so I fit in relatively quickly and almost felt as if I belonged. I soon adopted this newly found American culture and felt more at home than I did at home. I no longer associate color with beauty or power but a feature that separates individuals. There is a story, a beauty, a struggle behind every color. I have tried will all my will to make my family understand my perspective of color.  But that makes color  significant; everyone has their own way of perceiving it and creating their own definition.
