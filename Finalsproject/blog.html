    	<center><h1>#GamerGate</h1></center>	
    	<p> "#GamerGate" is an online movement ostensibly concerned with ethics in game journalism and with protecting the "gamer" identity. Beginning in August 2014, supporters of the Gamergate movement targeted several women in the video game industry, including game developers Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu, as well as feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend wrote a disparaging blog post about her, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included doxing threats of rape and death threats. Gamergate supporters claimed unethical collusion between the press and feminists, progressives, and social critics. These concerns have been dismissed by commentators as trivial, conspiracy theories, groundless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics.

		<h1>Gaming and Designing Justice </h1>
		</center>
		<p>The gaming community is very diverse. Ranging from all ages, genders, ethnicities, class, etc. In Lisa Nakamura’s Racism, Sexism, and Gaming’s Cruel Optimism article, she discusses “how a full class of thirty students are still unbalanced… however quite racially diverse”. Although the gaming community shares a range of social characteristics, the representation of the social categories in actual games are based on cliches.   Her students “readily admit that racism and sexism are pervasive… game industry can be brutal to women, people of color, sexual minorities, and anyone who signals difference online”. The trope “ damsel in distress” is featured in many video games. It involves a beautiful or innocent young woman, placed in a dire predicament by a villain, monster or alien, and who requires a male hero to achieve her rescue. After rescuing her, the hero often obtains her hand in marriage.  A similar term “women in the refrigerator”,  lists examples of the comic book trope whereby female characters are injured, killed, or depowered as a plot device.
