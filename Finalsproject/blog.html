    	<p> Beyonce’s “Formation” is activism for African Americans, women and the LGBTQ community. The music video to Formation, which she performed during the Super Bowl is being labeled as political because of references to Hurricane Katrina & BLM protests. This differentiates from other Ferguson protest songs like Rihanna’s “American Oxygen"or Kendrick Lamar’s "Alright” music video, which focuses on black mens deaths. Beyonce has become the symbol of feminism especially for African American women, In Formation she discusses her heritage, her form, her texture, Beyonce asks ladies to get in formation, stand together and ‘slay’; without a need of a significant other. Her Super Bowl performance raised controversy due to dancer’s outfits which resembled the Black Panther Party. The black female dancers which resembled the Black Panther party. The black female dancers got into an 'X’ formation, likely a nod to Malcolm X. In Brittney Coopers reading, she mentions intersectionality. of how there is interconnection of social categories such as race, class and gender; a system of discrimination/disadvantage embedded in each intersection. However, the most disadvantages in this system discriminates African American women the most. Beyonce is a leader of intersectional feminism. Bell Hooks argue that Beyonce is using Lemonade as a product to make profit for herself. She claims that black female bodies are sexualized and Beyonce is stealing the spotlight from the movement. She mentions that violence is no the right act for gender equality. Many critizes her for having “ghost writers”; so therefore whatever she sings arn’t original. Or the fact that she sings about Jay-Z but is still signed with his album record. Sara Ahmed;s article discusses “feminist killjoys”. She believes that “kill joyers” thinks that the joy is ignorant. And the refusal to look away from representations, disrupting the optimism. She is not a kill joy because she is well aware of feminism. Her arguments doesn’t not suggest that she is ignorant or refuses to look away from representations. Her arguments go against representations. Although she may not seem like a kill joy, in Ahmeds definition; if one consider Beyonce as a symbol for feminism, then in a sense she is a kill joy because she is dismissing Beyonce’s moment towards feminism</p>
