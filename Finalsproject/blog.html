    	<center><h1>#GamerGate</h1></center>	
    	<p> "#GamerGate" is an online movement ostensibly concerned with ethics in game journalism and with protecting the "gamer" identity. Beginning in August 2014, supporters of the Gamergate movement targeted several women in the video game industry, including game developers Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu, as well as feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend wrote a disparaging blog post about her, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included doxing threats of rape and death threats. Gamergate supporters claimed unethical collusion between the press and feminists, progressives, and social critics. These concerns have been dismissed by commentators as trivial, conspiracy theories, groundless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics.

		<h1>Gaming and Designing Justice </h1>
		</center>
		<p>The gaming community is very diverse. Ranging from all ages, genders, ethnicities, class, etc. In Lisa Nakamura’s Racism, Sexism, and Gaming’s Cruel Optimism article, she discusses “how a full class of thirty students are still unbalanced… however quite racially diverse”. Although the gaming community shares a range of social characteristics, the representation of the social categories in actual games are based on paratactical cliches.   Her students “readily admit that racism and sexism are pervasive… game industry can be brutal to women, people of color, sexual minorities, and anyone who signals difference online”. The trope “ damsel in distress” is featured in many video games. It involves a beautiful or innocent young woman, placed in a dire predicament by a villain, monster or alien, and who requires a male hero to achieve her rescue. The male hero is portrayed as courageous, strong and stoic. After rescuing her, the hero often obtains her hand in marriage.  A similar term “women in the refrigerator”,  lists examples of the comic book trope whereby female characters are injured, killed, or depowered as a plot device. The women is often sacrificed for the further development of the Hero. 
		</p>
		<p> One of the two common solutions is to rehabilitate games by diversifying game developers, to hire more women and programmers of color. With diverse developers, the representation of race and genders would be more applicable to players instead of stereotypes and generalizations created by developers who are not aware or experienced with the social structures. Developers should be encouraged to implement diversity when representing characters in their games. However, it is crucial to avoid misguided representations and stereotypes. The second strategy made by Nakamura and her students is to posit that it is “bad” female and nonwhite gamers themselves who are the problem. The best strategy for creating social justice, according to Nakamura is for stigmatized players to create habitable spaces for themselves by displays of superior skills, by proving their worth by dominating other players. Carol Stabile found in her study of gender-swapping as a form of making gender in “World of Warcraft, some female players she interviewed saw their skillful play as form of gender uplift within the game. One player explained that “she thought it was important to play the game and play it well as a female toon because it is communicated a positive message about female identity; that women can e powerful, strong and excellent players”.

		<center><h1>The Gamer stereotype</h1></center>
		<p>
		There is a general consensus for gamers among media groups, the typical overweight, acne-ridden males, living in their parent’s basements, surviving on a diet of Burgers and Redbull. They are smelly, unsociable cave dwellers; consumed in the latest internet meme that would only ever make sense to another ‘gamer’ that they have no chance of running into, as they never leave their darkened caves. Or a teenaged boy who comes home from school, throws down his backpack, and plops down in front of the television to play his Xbox One or PS4 for hours on end. Or raging kids blurbing profane language, being consumed by the violence. However, according to the Entertainment Software Association’s 2014 video game industry survey, 59% of Americans play video games. Of them, 71% are over 18 years old with the average age being 31 years old. And if you thought the demographics were dominated by men, you may want to reconsider: 48% of gamers are female.

		<center><h1>My experience as a gamer</h1></center>
		<p>
		l identify myself as an online gamer. One of the prime example of the gamer stereotype and design injustice is present in “League of Legends” (LOL). LOL is infamous for it's toxic players. I’ve been playing LOL for about 4 years. “League of Legends is a fast-paced, competitive online game that blends the speed and intensity of an RTS [Real Time Strategy] with RPG [Role Play] elements. Two teams of powerful champions, each with a unique design and playstyle, battle head-to-head across multiple battlefields and game modes. With an ever-expanding roster of champions, frequent updates and a thriving tournament scene, League of Legends offers endless replayability for players of every skill level.” This “classic” game play style is composed of  5v5 among players. The objective of the game is to destroy the opponent’s base before the enemy destroy’s their’s. Each game is about thirty minutes. There are over 130 unique champions that players can choose to fit their play style. A typical team of five will involve a top lane, jungle, middle lane, carry, and a support.  The roles of a support champion are to defend, heal and sacrifice for the carry champions. Most of the champions that are meant to be played as a support champions are females. The female champions are sexualized and only contends with their male counter parts through the use of magic or special weapons. Although the numbers of females to males ratio is not represented in the LOL database, the female players including my sister tend to play the support role. The support role is very undervalued and overlooked.The support champion is the one setting up the plays, engaging the battle, rescuing allies that are in danger. I value the support role because that is my main role. I find it one of the toughest role but one I most enjoy. The LOL community is very diverse. I've came across some of the friendlies players and some who are super toxic. The term “toxic” is described as the actions of a certain individual which actively or passively decrease the team morale and performance. A toxic person is also able to bring up negative behavior in other/neutral people. A toxic environment results in less team play and usually lost late game as people distrust each other. Although the LOL community have few toxic players, I’ve tend to come across a toxic player one out of five games. I generally try to encourage my team mates if they’re struggling or not performing their best. Oftentimes, the toxic player in my team would bash someone for not playing the objective or dying too often. The toxicity would even spread to me which ruin my game play experience. The general gaming community is consisted of friendly and genuine players. Few toxic players are responsible for ruining the image of gamers that are featured in media.
